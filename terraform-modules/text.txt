Modules are the key ingredient to writing reusable, maintainable,
and testable Terraform code...

 You’ll start building everything as a module, creating a library of modules to share within
your company, using modules that you find online, and thinking of your entire infra‐
structure as a collection of reusable modules...

syntax ; module "<NAME>" { 
           source = "<SOURCE>"
           [CONFIG ...]
         }

 # NAME is an identifier you can use throughout the Terraform code to refer to this module...
   SOURCE is the path where the module code can be found...
   CONFIG consists of one or more arguments that are specific to that module...
